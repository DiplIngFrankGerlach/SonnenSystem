# Planetary Simulation From ChatGPT

This project has been mostly generated by ChatGPT. Only secondary properties
of the code had to be adapted: float->double(to prevent arithmetic overflows)

## Precision
To achieve better precision of the simulation, the dt time step should probably
be reduced to a much smaller value.

## Compiler Needed
Needs version 4.x Sappeur Compiler to build: https://sappeur.di-fg.de

## Author
Author: Frank Gerlach and ChatGPT
